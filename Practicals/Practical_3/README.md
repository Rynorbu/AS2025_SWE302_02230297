**Git Repository:** [https://github.com/Rynorbu/Practical-3-Testing](https://github.com/Rynorbu/Practical-3-Testing)

### Function Specifications

This project implements and tests **two shipping fee calculation functions**:

#### 1. CalculateShippingFee (Advanced Version)
**Function Signature:** `CalculateShippingFee(weight float64, zone string, insured bool) (float64, error)`

**Business Rules:**
1. **Weight Tiers & Surcharges:**
   - 0 < weight ‚â§ 10 kg: Standard package (no surcharge)
   - 10 < weight ‚â§ 50 kg: Heavy package (+$7.50 surcharge)
   - Invalid: weight ‚â§ 0 or weight > 50

2. **Zone-Based Base Fees:**
   - "Domestic": $5.00 base fee
   - "International": $20.00 base fee  
   - "Express": $30.00 base fee
   - Any other zone is invalid

3. **Insurance:**
   - If insured = true: +1.5% of (Base Fee + Heavy Surcharge)
   - If insured = false: no additional cost

**Calculation Order:** `Final Fee = (Base Fee + Heavy Surcharge [if applicable]) + Insurance Cost [if applicable]`

#### 2. CalculateShippingFeeBasic (Simple Version)
**Function Signature:** `CalculateShippingFeeBasic(weight float64, zone string) (float64, error)`

**Business Rules:**
1. **Weight Validation:**
   - Valid range: 0 < weight ‚â§ 50 kg
   - Invalid: weight ‚â§ 0 or weight > 50

2. **Zone-Based Pricing:**
   - "Domestic": $5.00 + (weight √ó $1.00)
   - "International": $20.00 + (weight √ó $2.50)
   - "Express": $30.00 + (weight √ó $5.00)
   - Any other zone is invalid

**Calculation Formula:** `Final Fee = Base Fee + (Weight √ó Zone Multiplier)`

## Part 1: Test Case Design Analysis

### Equivalence Partitioning

#### Weight Input (float64)
- **P1: Invalid - Too Small** (weight ‚â§ 0)
  - *Justification:* Any weight ‚â§ 0 violates business rule #1 and should return an error
  - *Representative values:* -5.0, 0.0

- **P2: Valid - Standard Package** (0 < weight ‚â§ 10)
  - *Justification:* Weights in this range qualify as "Standard" packages with no surcharge
  - *Representative values:* 5.0, 8.0, 3.0

- **P3: Valid - Heavy Package** (10 < weight ‚â§ 50)
  - *Justification:* Weights in this range qualify as "Heavy" packages with $7.50 surcharge
  - *Representative values:* 15.0, 25.0, 35.0

- **P4: Invalid - Too Large** (weight > 50)
  - *Justification:* Any weight > 50 violates business rule #1 and should return an error
  - *Representative values:* 51.0, 100.0

#### Zone Input (string)
- **P5: Valid Zones** 
  - *Values:* {"Domestic", "International", "Express"}
  - *Justification:* These exact strings are the only valid zones per business rule #2

- **P6: Invalid Zones**
  - *Justification:* Any string not in the valid set should return an error
  - *Representative values:* "", "domestic" (lowercase), "Local", "Unknown"

#### Insured Input (bool)
- **P7: Insured** (true)
  - *Justification:* When true, adds 1.5% insurance cost to subtotal

- **P8: Not Insured** (false)
  - *Justification:* When false, no insurance cost is added

---

### Boundary Value Analysis

#### Weight Boundaries

**Lower Boundary (around 0):**
- **0.0** - Last invalid value (should error)
  - *Justification:* Tests the exact boundary condition where weight becomes invalid
- **0.1** - First valid value in Standard range
  - *Justification:* Tests that values just above 0 are correctly accepted

**Mid Boundary (around 10kg - Standard/Heavy threshold):**
- **10.0** - Last value in Standard range (no surcharge)
  - *Justification:* Critical boundary - exactly 10kg should NOT trigger heavy surcharge
- **10.1** - First value in Heavy range (+$7.50 surcharge)
  - *Justification:* Values just above 10kg should trigger the heavy surcharge

**Upper Boundary (around 50kg):**
- **50.0** - Last valid value in Heavy range
  - *Justification:* Maximum valid weight should be accepted with surcharge
- **50.1** - First invalid value above range (should error)
  - *Justification:* Any weight above 50kg should be rejected

#### Why These Boundaries Matter
These boundary values are critical because:
1. **Off-by-one errors** are common in conditional logic
2. **Floating-point precision** issues can occur at boundaries
3. **Business logic transitions** happen at these exact points
4. **Edge cases** often reveal implementation bugs

## Part 2: Test Implementation Strategy

### Test Organization
The test suite is organized using Go's table-driven testing pattern with the following sections:

1. **Invalid Weight Cases** - Tests P1 and P4 partitions
2. **Invalid Zone Cases** - Tests P6 partition  
3. **Boundary Value Analysis** - Tests critical boundary conditions
4. **Valid Equivalence Partitions** - Tests P2, P3, P5 combinations
5. **Insurance Testing** - Tests P7 with various combinations
6. **Comprehensive Boundary + Insurance** - Tests boundary values with insurance

### Key Test Cases & Justifications

#### Critical Calculation Examples:

**Standard Domestic Uninsured (5kg, "Domestic", false):**
- Expected: $5.00 (base fee only)
- Validates: Basic calculation without surcharge or insurance

**Heavy International Insured (25kg, "International", true):**
- Expected: $27.9125 = $20.00 + $7.50 + ($27.50 √ó 0.015)
- Validates: All three components of the calculation

**Boundary Case (10kg, "International", true):**
- Expected: $20.30 = $20.00 + ($20.00 √ó 0.015)
- Validates: Exactly 10kg does NOT get heavy surcharge

**Boundary Case (10.1kg, "Express", true):**
- Expected: $38.0625 = $30.00 + $7.50 + ($37.50 √ó 0.015)
- Validates: Just above 10kg DOES get heavy surcharge

### Error Handling Tests
All error cases validate:
- Proper error return (not nil)
- Zero fee return on error
- Descriptive error messages containing expected text

### Floating Point Considerations
Tests use a tolerance of 0.001 for floating-point comparisons to handle precision issues in insurance calculations.

## Challenges Encountered

#### 1. Boundary Condition Complexity

**Challenge**: The 10kg threshold creates a critical boundary where surcharge logic changes.

**Specific Issue**: Ensuring 10.0kg gets no surcharge while 10.1kg gets the $7.50 surcharge required careful test design.

**Solution**: Created specific test cases for both sides of the boundary:

- 10.0kg ‚Üí Standard package (no surcharge)
- 10.1kg ‚Üí Heavy package (+$7.50 surcharge)

#### 2. Error Message Consistency

**Challenge**: Testing error conditions required validating both error occurrence and message content.

**Solution**: Used substring matching with `strings.Contains()` to verify error messages contain expected keywords without being overly strict about exact formatting.

#### 3. Test Case Completeness

**Challenge**: Ensuring complete coverage without over-testing required balancing thoroughness with efficiency.

**Solution**: Applied systematic equivalence partitioning to identify minimum test cases that achieve maximum coverage, then supplemented with boundary value analysis.

**Challenge**: Insurance cost calculation involves multiple steps: (base fee + surcharge) √ó 1.5%.

**Complex Example**:

- Heavy International Insured (25kg): $20.00 + $7.50 = $27.50, then $27.50 √ó 0.015 = $0.4125
- Final: $27.50 + $0.4125 = $27.9125

**Solution**: Created detailed test cases with step-by-step calculation comments to verify each component of the formula.

### Key Insights Gained

1. **Black-Box Testing Effectiveness**: Systematic test design based on specifications caught edge cases without needing implementation knowledge
2. **Boundary Testing Critical**: Most potential bugs occur at boundary conditions (0kg, 10kg, 50kg thresholds)
3. **Floating-Point Considerations**: Financial calculations require careful tolerance handling in tests
4. **Error Testing Importance**: Proper error handling is as critical as successful path testing
5. **Test Organization Benefits**: Table-driven tests with descriptive names greatly improve maintainability
6. **Complete Coverage Achievement**: Adding tests for previously untested functions demonstrates the importance of comprehensive coverage analysis

### Testing Best Practices Demonstrated

- **100% Coverage Achievement**: Both functions now have complete statement coverage
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: All equivalence partitions and boundaries tested across both functions
- **Clear Test Names**: Self-documenting test case descriptions for 46+ test scenarios
- **Proper Error Validation**: Both error occurrence and content verified for all error paths
- **Tolerance Handling**: Appropriate floating-point comparison methods for financial calculations
- **Systematic Approach**: Methodical test design based on testing theory applied to both simple and complex functions
- **Maintainable Structure**: Table-driven tests that are easy to extend and modify
- **Dual Function Testing**: Demonstrates testing strategies for both simple linear calculations and complex multi-factor formulas

### Project Achievement Summary

This comprehensive testing implementation successfully demonstrates:

- **Complete Test Coverage**: 100% statement coverage across all shipping calculation functions
- **Robust Error Handling**: All invalid input scenarios properly tested and validated
- **Business Logic Verification**: Every business rule confirmed through systematic testing

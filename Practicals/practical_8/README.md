## What I Have Learned

This practical exercise taught me many important lessons about testing web applications. I learned both technical skills and practical approaches that will help me in future projects.

**Writing Better Tests**

The first important thing I learned was how to select elements properly in tests. Instead of using CSS classes or IDs that might change when designers update the styling, I learned to use special data testid attributes. This makes tests more stable because they won't break when someone changes the appearance of the application. It also makes the code clearer because anyone reading it can immediately see which elements are used for testing.

**Understanding Cypress Features**

Cypress has a smart feature that automatically waits for things to load. At first, I wanted to add manual waits everywhere, but I discovered this was unnecessary. Cypress keeps checking if elements are ready and automatically retries commands. This made my tests faster and more reliable. Instead of guessing how long to wait, I let Cypress handle the timing naturally.

**Organizing Tests Properly**

I learned that each test should work independently. Every test sets up its own data and doesn't depend on other tests running first. This makes debugging much easier. When a test fails, I know exactly what went wrong without worrying about side effects from previous tests. I used beforeEach hooks to share common setup code without creating dependencies between tests.

**Focusing on User Experience**

I changed how I think about testing. Instead of checking if specific functions were called or variables were updated, I focused on what users actually see and do. This approach is better because the tests stay valid even when I reorganize the internal code. As long as the application works the same way for users, the tests pass.

**Working with API Mocking**

API mocking became one of my favorite techniques. By creating fake API responses, I made my tests run much faster. They also became more reliable because they don't depend on internet connection or external services. I could easily test error situations that would be hard to create with a real API. Using fixtures to store test data made everything more organized and consistent.

**Using Page Objects**

The Page Object Model changed how I write test code. I put all the element selectors and common actions in one place. Now when the UI changes, I only update the page object file instead of changing many test files. This saves time and reduces mistakes. It also makes the tests easier to read and understand.

**Learning About Accessibility**

Accessibility testing opened my eyes to important issues I hadn't considered before. I used the axe core tool to check if the application follows accessibility standards. Testing keyboard navigation showed me how people who don't use a mouse interact with websites. I realized that making applications accessible isn't difficult, it just requires paying attention and using the right testing tools.

**Keeping Tests Organized**

Good organization made a big difference as the test suite grew. I grouped related tests together in the same file, used clear file names, and created a logical folder structure. Writing descriptive test names helped me understand what each test does. When tests fail, the clear names make it easy to identify the problem.

**Benefits of TypeScript**

Using TypeScript with my tests was very helpful. It caught errors while I was writing code instead of when running tests. The autocomplete feature in my editor made writing tests faster and helped me avoid typos. Creating type definitions for custom commands made the code easier to understand and maintain.

**Debugging Skills**

I learned valuable debugging techniques. Cypress has a time travel feature that shows exactly what the application looked like at each test step. This made it easy to see where things went wrong. Using cy.intercept() helped me check API calls and responses. The automatic screenshots and videos that Cypress creates when tests fail made debugging much simpler.

**Preparing for Real Projects**

I gained experience setting up tests for continuous integration. Running tests automatically when code changes gives confidence that nothing broke. The tests can run on multiple machines at the same time, which saves time and provides quick feedback to developers.

## Conclusion

This practical exercise gave me valuable hands on experience with modern web application testing. Building and testing the Dog Image Browser application taught me how to create comprehensive tests that actually work in real situations.

**What I Accomplished**

I created 34 different test cases organized across 9 test files. All tests pass consistently in both the visual testing mode and the automated headless mode. This wasn't just about getting tests to pass, it was about learning to think through all the different ways users might interact with the application. I had to consider normal usage, edge cases, and error situations. Achieving 100% pass rate and zero accessibility violations showed me that thorough testing is achievable with the right approach.

**Key Skills Developed**

The most valuable skill I developed was learning to write maintainable test code. I created custom commands that I could reuse across different tests, which saved time and made the code cleaner. The Page Object Model pattern taught me to organize test code in a way that's easy to update when the application changes. These patterns showed me that test code deserves the same care and attention as the main application code.

**Understanding API Testing**

Working with API mocking changed my perspective on testing. At first, I thought about testing with the real API, but that approach had many problems. The tests would be slow, might fail due to network issues, and couldn't easily test error conditions. By using mock data and fixtures, I created tests that run quickly every time and can test any scenario I need. This practical approach made my test suite reliable and useful.

**Accessibility Awareness**

Testing for accessibility made me a more thoughtful developer. Before this project, I knew accessibility was important but didn't know how to test for it properly. Using axe core and testing keyboard navigation showed me that checking accessibility isn't complicated. It just requires using the right tools and thinking about different ways people use applications. Achieving zero accessibility violations proved that building inclusive applications is a realistic goal.

**Problem Solving Experience**

Throughout the project, I faced various challenges. Handling timing issues, organizing test data, and configuring TypeScript all required problem solving. Each challenge taught me something useful. For example, learning to use Cypress's automatic retry feature solved flakiness issues. Organizing tests with proper hooks made them more reliable. These solutions will help me in future projects.

**Broader Technical Growth**

Beyond testing, I improved my overall development skills. Working with Next.js 15, TypeScript, and modern React expanded my knowledge of frontend development. I learned how to structure API routes, manage state, and build responsive interfaces. Understanding both how to build applications and how to test them properly gives me a complete perspective on web development.

**New Perspective on Testing**

The most important insight from this practical is that testing isn't just a final step before releasing code. Testing is part of the development process itself. Good tests help me write better code, catch problems early, and give me confidence to make changes without fear of breaking things. The test suite serves as documentation showing how the application should work. It acts as a safety net that lets me improve code without worry.

**Looking Ahead**

This practical built a strong foundation for future improvements. I could add visual regression testing to catch unexpected UI changes. Performance testing could ensure the application stays fast. Integration with automated deployment pipelines could run tests on every code change. The solid foundation I created makes these additions straightforward.

**Final Thoughts**

This practical changed how I think about software development. I now understand that testing is a valuable tool that makes development faster and less stressful, not a burden that slows things down. The skills I learned, from writing effective tests to debugging complex issues, are directly useful for real projects. I'm grateful for this practical experience and confident about applying these lessons in my future work.

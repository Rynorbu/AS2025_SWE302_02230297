This repository is dedicated to storing all of my practical exercises and assignments from the SWE302 Software Testing and Quality Assurance module; it not only contains the work I completed for practice and evaluation but also reflects my growing understanding of the principles taught throughout the course. It serves as a structured collection of my efforts to grasp fundamental testing methods and quality assurance practices, while at the same time acting as a personal record of the concepts I have learned and applied during the module; in this way, the repository stands as both a learning archive and a demonstration of applied knowledge.This repository is dedicated to storing all of my practical exercises and assignments from the SWE302 Software Testing and Quality Assurance module; it not only contains the work I completed for practice and evaluation but also reflects my growing understanding of the principles taught throughout the course.
